To run the servers and code first compile the java classes:

`javac Client.java`

`javac ClientHandler.java`

`javac Server.java`


Then start up the Server.java with:

`java Server.java`

Then start the Client:

`java Client.java`


The Client will first be prompted to enter a username. After the user puts in their uid the Server recieves that, and tells the Client hi.


The user can then create a project file with

`create <project_file_name>`

The user can view their projects by typing

`list projects`
